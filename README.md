## Overview

![Windbnb Preview](https://github.com/varJonathanR/github-jobs/blob/main/public/github-jobs_preview.png)

This project has marked a before and after in my learning process. It was very challenging, and I learned to improve how I share state information between my components, as well as how to optimize my code to avoid repeating functions. I had a lot of fun with this project, and I am very happy that, as I progress, I depend less on external help and am able to think and create my own solutions.
